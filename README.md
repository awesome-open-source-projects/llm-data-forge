# LLM Data Forge

**LLM Data Forge** is an open-source project dedicated to advancing Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing a platform for high-quality data generation through community contributions.

## Overview

As highlighted in [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2025/06/25/what-happens-when-llms-run-out-of-useful-data/), large language models could run out of fresh, human-generated training data as soon as 2026. This limitation, coupled with inherent flaws in LLMs such as hallucinations and undetectable biases, poses a significant challenge to the development and reliability of future models. The phenomenon known as [**AI Inbreeding**](https://bernardmarr.com/generative-ai-and-the-risk-of-inbreeding/) can exacerbate these issues, as undetectable flaws in LLM outputs may be recycled in new data.

In response to these challenges, LLM Data Forge aims to create a collaborative environment where anyone can produce quality text for training LLMs.

## Vision

Our vision is to build a comprehensive website and dedicated applications across all platforms that enable users to sign up and start generating content for AI. For instance, if we achieve **20,000 active users** generating **250 tokens per day**, we could produce **5 million tokens daily**, resulting in approximately **1.825 billion tokens** per year.

While this is only a fraction of the **300 billion tokens** used to train GPT-3, it represents a meaningful contribution and supports our goal of gathering **extra reliable data** for training.

## Benefits of LLM Data Forge

- **User Profiling:** By collecting information about users (age, name, ethnicity, personal preferences), we can enhance LLMs' understanding of diverse perspectives and responses.
- **Content Control:** Our platform allows for quality control by screening generated content for offensive language and hateful speech, and by elaborating on complex topics that are often overlooked.
- **Cross-Language Support:** By providing accurate translations for entries in our database, we can improve the translation capabilities of LLMs and create reliable multilingual bridges.

## Collaboration

This project is open-source, and we welcome contributions from anyone with programming knowledge, regardless of their expertise. The scope of LLM Data Forge is vast, and there are numerous ways to contribute.
